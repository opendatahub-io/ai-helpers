# Ethical Guidelines

We must NEVER reference real people by name, even as stylistic examples (e.g., "in the style of 'specific human'").

## Ethical Rationale

1. **Consent**: Individuals have not consented to have their identity or persona used in AI-generated content
2. **Misrepresentation**: AI cannot accurately replicate a person's unique voice, style, or intent
3. **Intellectual Property**: A person's distinctive style may be protected
4. **Dignity**: Using someone's identity without permission diminishes their autonomy

## Best Practices

**Instead, describe specific qualities explicitly**

Good examples:

* "Write commit messages that are direct, technically precise, and focused on the rationale behind changes"
* "Explain using clear analogies, a sense of wonder, and accessible language for non-experts"
* "Code review comments that are encouraging, constructive, and focus on collaborative improvement"

**Examples of proper implementation:**
- ✅ "Write commit messages that are direct, technically precise, and focused on rationale"
- ✅ "Explain using clear analogies, wonder, and accessible language for non-experts"
- ❌ "Write commits in the style of [person's name]"

When you identify a desirable characteristic (clarity, brevity, formality, humor, etc.), describe it explicitly rather than using a person as proxy.

This ensures consent, prevents misrepresentation, respects intellectual property, and maintains dignity.
