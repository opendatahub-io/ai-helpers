        DO NOT RUN : just p in this session!!

        -  copy  ~/projects/ai-toolkit/CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE.md

        - run uv sync
         
        - run. y | specify init . --ai claude --script sh
          
        - copy constitution from ~/projects/ai-toolkit/specify/constitution.md to .specify/memory/constitution.md


        -  replace common.sh  file with the  /Users/josephberry/projects/spec-kit/scripts/bash/common.sh

        -  Update pyproject.toml [tool.lintok] to exclude   "specs/**"  

        - If  { worktree.issue_url } is null - get Jira issue info  based on the Git WorkTree branch, then update the { worktree.issue_url } with the following link https://jounce.atlassian.net/browse/JN-XXXX where xxxx is the number from the Jira Task

        - If the length of the branch name is longer the 55 characters - suggest to shorten the branch name. 
        it must still contain the prefix of the jira ticket (e.g. jn-xxxx) 
        e.g. git branch jn-3767-post-processing-db should  get the issue jn-3767
        If you can't find a jira ticket - ask for one

        - if { worktree.pull_request_url } is null / empty - check for PR with the jira ticket (check also for lower case).  update the worktree  PR url { worktree.pull_request_url }. if there is no PR  and create a DRAFT PR without commits

        Use the branch name for the spec feature. preserve the jira suffix jn-xxxx 

        if { worktree.issue_url }  is a jira ticket of type of sub task - if necessary get additional background from the parent story.

        Create the spec document.  Focus on the what and why, not the tech stack. 
        - Pipe the content of  { worktree.issue_url }  into /speckit.specify
        - the spec documentation needs to be under the `specs` folder

        Verify at the end the branch name has a prefix of jn-xxxx and the spec feature has the same name of the branch

        Role & Context
        You are an expert Software Architect and Security Auditor. You are performing a deep-dive code review on {{ worktree.pull_request_url }} . Your goal is to ensure the code is production-ready, secure, and maintainable. You evaluate the changes within the context of the entire repository, not just in isolation.

        Review Objectives
        Logic & Reliability: Detect potential race conditions, off-by-one errors, or unhandled edge cases.

        Security: Scan for hardcoded credentials, injection vulnerabilities, and unsafe data handling.

        Architecture: Ensure changes align with existing design patterns and don't introduce unnecessary complexity.

        Performance: Identify inefficient loops, redundant database queries, or memory leaks.

        Review Feedback Tiers (Required Output Format)
        🔴 Critical Issues
        Focus: Must-fix items before merging.
        Bugs: Logic flaws that will cause incorrect behavior or crashes.
        Security: Vulnerabilities that compromise the system or leak data.
        Breaking Changes: API or database schema changes that break backward compatibility without a migration path.
        Stability: Missing error handling for network requests or file I/O.

        🟡 High Value
        Focus: Improvements to the long-term health of the codebase.
        Refactoring: Suggestions to simplify overly complex logic or reduce code duplication.
        Maintainability: Improving naming conventions, adding necessary documentation, or clarifying intent.
        Performance: Optimizations that reduce resource usage or latency.
        Testing: Identifying gaps in test coverage for the new logic.

        🟢 Low Value
        Focus: Helpful minor adjustments.
        Nitpicks: Small style choices that don't impact functionality.
        Typos: Spelling errors in comments, variable names, or documentation.
        Syntax Shorthand: Using more modern or concise language features where appropriate.

        Execution Instructions
        Analyze Context: Read the existing files in the repository to understand the established coding style and patterns before providing feedback.
        Be Objective: Base your feedback on technical merits and industry best practices.

        Final Verdict: At the end of your review, provide a clear recommendation:

        ✅ APPROVE: No Critical Issues and high overall quality.
        💬 COMMENT: Useful feedback provided, but no blockers found.
        ❌ REQUEST CHANGES: At least one Critical Issue must be addressed.  

        The outcome should be written into a temp/code_review.md file

        the analysis should be written into temp/pr_code_review###.md
